what if he bites too hard and gets drunk bro?
Never give a golden retriever access to your fridge. They eat everything
Awwwww he thought you needed a drink 😂 what a cutie.
This is a great trick until the day you come home to a passed out pooch and empty beer cans 😂😂😂
He was like “YOUR DEHYDRATED DRINK!” 😂😂
Thought for a minute about teaching my golden to do this but then thought “so he will know how to open the fridge, nope it will be more than a beer can he’ll pull out when I’m not in the room” 😂😂
I feel bad, i mean he just wanted to give u drink to relax. he is so cute🥰
that's why I love golden retrievers 💕💕
Not the look behind to see if you were watching
He was like “Here’s your drink hooman!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nevertheless: good girl
What a useful command! Up until the family jewels are involved! 🤣
My dog would make me an alcoholic, cus how could I refuse such cuteness 😂
My dad taught one of our labs to bring drinks up from the basement. It went well until she somehow punctured a can and it sprayed all over the stairs and ceiling 😂
he knew u wanted a drink he just didnt know where to drop it
And nothing can go wrong✨ OH NO IT ALL WENT WRONG
he was just making sure that you stayed hydrated🤣
this is the only reason my dad would own dog
did he at least get a treat
Ellieee!!!! 🥺🥺🥺
The way he looked over his shoulder lol
GOOD GIRL ELLIE 🤣🤣
awww I love them soo much 🥺♥️
Good job elliee
Its five oclock somewhere
@ryanfitzgerald107 watch to the end
@𝕏𝕩_𝕔𝕝𝕠𝕦𝕕𝕚𝕫𝕫_𝕩𝕏 we need to do it!
He’s like I want a treat maybe if we trade I’ll get one 😂
He was like" My man be working out so hard,let me just....oh yeah grab a lil something for him from the fridge"🤣🤣😅😅
Awwww he thought he was being helpful! What a sweetheart!
My dad has the same beers
Hes so proud tho
still a good dog ✌😂
"yo go get me a beer"
Awwwwwwww i love this dag❤❤❤❤
Nope. My dog would straight up eat all the cheese and fruits
Fantastic NA beer. The only NA beer I enjoy.
taught my German shepherd this and he ate all the Thanksgiving leftovers
Cannot see what could possibly go wrong with teaching a golden retriever to open the fridge 🤣🤣🤣
“Why are you drinking so early?” “My dog said I could” 😂
bro forgot the battle of yultong
Good job Ellie
I want to go walkkies, but I know how to wake him up. 😬
